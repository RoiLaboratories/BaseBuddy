# Wallet Renaming Fix Guide

## Issue Overview
Users reported that wallet names were displaying as "Renamed Wallet [timestamp]" instead of the user-provided names when using the rename functionality.

## Root Cause
1. The issue was caused by test scripts that were using timestamps to generate wallet names:
   ```typescript
   const newName = `Renamed Wallet ${Date.now()}`;
   ```
2. These test scripts were accidentally inserting these timestamp-based names into the actual database.
3. The wallet renaming functionality itself was working correctly, but the test scripts were interfering.

## Fix Implementation

We've fixed the issue with several improvements:

1. **Enhanced Detection and Prevention**:
   - The `updateWalletName` function now detects timestamp pattern names and blocks them
   - User input is validated to prevent timestamp-format names
   - Better validation throughout the rename process

2. **Database Cleanup**:
   - Added a script to automatically fix existing wallets with timestamp-based names
   - Converts any "Renamed Wallet [timestamp]" names to normal wallet names

3. **Test Script Management**:
   - Added functionality to automatically move test scripts to a backup folder
   - Prevents test scripts from interfering with the bot

## How to Run the Fix

Choose one of these options to fix the issue:

1. **Complete Fix** (recommended):
   ```
   .\complete-fix.ps1
   ```
   or
   ```
   .\complete-fix.bat
   ```
   This will:
   - Stop any running bots
   - Fix all existing wallet names with timestamp patterns
   - Start the bot with the fixed code

2. **Fix Database Only**:
   ```
   .\fix-database.bat
   ```
   This will fix the existing wallet names without starting the bot.

3. **Quick Fix and Run**:
   ```
   .\fix-and-run.bat
   ```
   This combines disabling test scripts, fixing the database, and starting the bot.

## Testing the Fix

After running the fix:

1. Send `/wallets` to the bot
2. Click the "✏️ Rename" button
3. Choose a wallet
4. Enter a name like "Trading" or "Savings"
5. Verify the name is properly saved and displayed

## Permanent Solution

The fix includes:
- Prevention of timestamp-format names
- Blocking of test scripts that were causing the issue
- Database cleanup to fix existing affected wallets
- Enhanced validation of user input
- Better logging for future troubleshooting
