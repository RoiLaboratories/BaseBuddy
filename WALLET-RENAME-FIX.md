# Wallet Rename Fix Documentation

## Issue Summary
Users reported that when attempting to rename wallets in the BaseBuddy Telegram bot, the renamed wallets were displaying as "Renamed Wallet [timestamp]" instead of the user-provided names.

## Root Cause Analysis
After thorough investigation, we discovered that:

1. The wallet renaming functionality in the bot was actually working correctly
2. The test scripts (`test-wallet-rename.ts`) were using timestamps for testing wallet names:
   ```typescript
   const newName = `Renamed Wallet ${Date.now()}`;
   ```
3. This created confusion because the test wallets always showed timestamp-based names
4. When an actual user provides a name like "Trading" or "Savings", it would save correctly

## Solution Implemented

We implemented several improvements to ensure the wallet renaming functionality works reliably:

1. Enhanced the `updateWalletName` function in `supabaseClient.ts`:
   - Added better error handling and validation
   - Added detailed logging with `[WALLET RENAME]` prefix
   - Added verification of the update result

2. Improved the text handler for wallet renaming in `telegramBot.ts`:
   - Enhanced error handling and feedback to user
   - Added a waiting message during the rename operation
   - Added verification after renaming to confirm the update was successful

3. Updated `renameWallet` function in `telegramBot.ts`:
   - Added input validation to check if the wallet name is valid
   - Added validation to check if wallet exists before updating
   - Added verification after update to ensure name was updated correctly
   - Improved error handling and logging

4. Created a script to verify the fix with static names:
   - `test-fixed-name.ts` uses a consistent name instead of a timestamp
   - `verify-rename-fix.ps1` provides a simple way to test the fix

## Testing Verification

1. Database Testing:
   - Direct database testing with static name "Trading Wallet" confirmed successful updates
   - Verification step confirmed the new name is stored and retrieved correctly

2. Bot Functionality Testing:
   - Verified the wallet renaming dialog works through the Telegram interface
   - Confirmed user-provided names are saved correctly and displayed in the wallet list
   - Verified error handling when invalid names are provided

## Conclusion

The wallet renaming functionality works correctly. The apparent issue was due to testing with timestamp-based names rather than a problem with the actual functionality. The improvements added make the rename process more robust with better validation, verification, and user feedback.
